We will inform you if we cannot verify your identity. Please note-<br /><br />
<ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request for categories of Personal Information, we may deny the request. If the request is denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will provide a copy of, or direct you to, our Privacy Policy.</li>
<br />
<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making the request for specific pieces of Personal Information, we are prohibited from disclosing any specific pieces of Personal Information to the requestor. However, if denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will evaluate the request as if it is seeking the disclosure of categories of Personal Information about the consumer.</li>
<br />
<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request to delete, we may deny the request. If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor to the degree of certainty required, we will state this in our response and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li><em>Authorized Agents:</em>&nbsp;Authorized agents may submit requests via the methods identified in this Policy. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete, we may require you to: (1) provide the authorized agent with signed permission to do so; (2) verify your identity directly with us; and (3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. However, we will not require these actions if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code.</li>
<br />
<li><em>Excessive Requests:</em>&nbsp;If requests from a User are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the User of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.</li>
<br />
<li><em>CCPA Non-Discrimination:</em>&nbsp;You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us due to your exercise of the rights provided by the CCPA. We do not offer financial incentives and price or service differences, and we do not discriminate against Users/consumers for exercising their rights under the CCPA.</li>
