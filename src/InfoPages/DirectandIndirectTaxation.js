      <p>Attitudes to tax are changing. Organizations of all sizes are increasingly exposed to new trends 
      in tax regulation.
      </p>
      <p>Enhancing a shareholder's value is a fundamental concept which drives every management effort in 
      the modern business environment. Progressive and bottom-line focussed managements have realized 
      that taxes (both direct and indirect), should be viewed as a dynamic item of cost rather than a 
      passive charge on the profits. Indeed, an effective tax-cost management provides a distinct 
      competitive advantage. In order to accomplish this, appropriate tax strategies need to be 
      identified proactively and implemented surgically.
